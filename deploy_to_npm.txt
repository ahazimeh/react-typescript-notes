npm init -y
before deploying to npm follow these steps:
1- make sure out package name is unique
2- specify which files should be sent to npm when we publish ("files": ["dist"],) //I added this to package.json
3- split our dependencies and devDependencies
4- set our package to be publicly accessible
    in package.json
    "publishConfig": {
        "access": "public"
    },
5- if building a cli, configure the file to run
    "bin": "dist/index.js",
    and in the index.ts and this line to the top
    #!/usr/bin/env node
    this will allow us to directly execute this file rather than first writing node index.js
6- add a prepublish script
    in the script section add this
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run build"
7- optional step: commit to git
8- run np, publish
